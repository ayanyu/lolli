<h1>Lolli (Sweet Shop):</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<h4> I have created a sweet shop website name <strong> Lolli </strong> using languages such as PHP and MySQL database and simple Javascript was used to make the menu pop up in the nav bar. I have also used html5 and css3 and bootstrap for the skeleton of the project. </h4>

<h4>One of the first challenges I faced in the project was trying to sync the database from the chart already created in class into the phpmyadmin. However once I learned about the import feature and changed the file from a zip file, I was able to easily upload and connect the database. Once I connected the database, the rest of the items that was in the database was able to appear in the front page of the website and the connection was successful. </h4>

<h4>Something new which I learned in this project, was knowing how to add a mysqli assoc and view all the associate arrays from the original page source. This gave me the confirmation that all the store items were transferred successfully from the database.

<h1>Conclusion: </h1>

<h4> Overall, this project was a successful opportunity for me to implement all my PHP and mySQL life lessons in to a project.

<h1><strong>ADDITION/ 90% completed:</h4></strong>

<h4> I am going to be adding option to delete or add to the shopping cart using vanilla javascript. </h4>
